# Vybe – MVP Scope

## Goal
Deliver a **minimum viable product** (MVP) that demonstrates Vybe’s unique concept:
- Mood-driven navigation into creator-led **Looprooms**
- Feed fallback when no Looprooms exist
- Verified creators who can host rooms and post content
- Admin moderation tools
- A professional **landing page + waitlist** to attract early adopters

---

## MVP Deliverables

### 1. Landing Page (Public)
- Responsive, modern, minimalist design (light + dark themes).
- Sections:
  - Hero (headline, subtext, CTA: “Join Waitlist”).
  - How It Works (mood → looproom → loopchain).
  - Why Vybe (positive-only interactions, trust via creator verification, feed fallback).
  - Waitlist form (email capture, success state).
  - Footer (minimal links).
- Animated navbar:
  - Enlarged state on top (hover effect, like portfolio reference).
  - Shrinks when scrolling down.

---

### 2. Authentication
- Options: Email, Google, Apple.
- Anonymous join (Recovery Looprooms only).
- Creator flow: must complete onboarding with ID + selfie verification before gaining creator privileges.

---

### 3. User Experience
- **Mood input** (preset moods + free-text) → recommended looproom if available.
- If no looproom exists → redirect to **feed** (similar to Instagram/Facebook).
- Inside looprooms:
  - Media player (live, pre-recorded, playlist integration).
  - Chat system.
  - Positive emoji → triggers motivational text.
  - CTA: “Next room” (loopchain navigation).

---

### 4. Feed
- Users scroll posts if no looproom available.
- Posts include text, images, video, or playlist links.
- Engagement: comments + positive-only reactions.
- Clean layout: center content + side panel/top panel navigation.

---

### 5. Creators
- Must pass onboarding (ID + selfie check).
- Can:
  - Create Looprooms.
  - Share unique room links with external communities.
  - Post content to the feed.

---

### 6. Admin
- **Dashboard** with moderation tools:
  - Delete posts, comments, users.
  - Oversee creator verification.
  - Monitor Looproom and feed activity.

---

## Out of Scope (Future Releases)
- Monetization (subscriptions, donations).
- Advanced analytics.
- Complex recommendation system (basic mapping only for MVP).
- Mobile apps (MVP is responsive web-first).
