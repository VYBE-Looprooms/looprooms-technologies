# Vybe – Full Concept

## Overview
Vybe is a mood-driven, creator-led platform where **Looprooms** act as interactive spaces for connection, growth, and community. Users enter Looprooms based on their mood, interests, or creator invitations. If no Looprooms are currently active, users are redirected to a **feed**, similar to Instagram or Facebook, where they scroll through posts, engage, and comment.

The platform balances **social interaction**, **content creation**, and **mental wellness** by combining traditional feeds with structured live/async sessions.

## Core Components

### 1. Users
- **Join via email or OAuth** (Google/Apple).  
- **Anonymous option** in sensitive categories (e.g., Recovery rooms).  
- Enter a mood or interest → get recommended Looprooms (if available).  
- If no Looproom exists → redirected to **feed** with creator posts.  
- Inside Looprooms:  
  - Participate in chat.  
  - Send **positive-only emoji reactions** that trigger motivational text.  
  - View media (live streams, pre-recorded, playlists).  
  - Follow **Loopchains**: curated paths that connect related rooms.

### 2. Creators
- **Onboarding & Verification**  
  - Provide legal ID (passport, ID card).  
  - Upload a selfie for identity check.  
  - System verifies automatically before granting creator access.  
- **Capabilities**  
  - Create Looprooms: upload media, tag topics, define loopchain connections.  
  - Share unique Looproom links with their community.  
  - Post to the feed (text, image, video, playlist links).  
  - Engage with users via chat, comments, and motivational cues.

### 3. Admins
- **Dashboard** for moderation:  
  - Full feed access (with moderation tools).  
  - Ability to delete posts, comments, or users.  
  - Oversee creator onboarding and ID verification.  
  - Monitor Looproom activity and loopchains.

## Key Features

- **Looprooms**: Thematic rooms where creators and users connect.  
- **Loopchains**: Linked rooms that form guided experiences (e.g., Recovery → Fitness → Healthy Living).  
- **Feed fallback**: Users never face an empty state; if no Looproom exists, they scroll a feed with posts.  
- **Positive-only interactions**: Emoji → motivational line, eliminating toxicity.  
- **Creator link sharing**: Viral growth by letting creators invite external audiences directly into rooms.  
- **Identity verification**: Ensures authenticity and trust in creator-led rooms.  
- **Admin oversight**: Protects community standards and safety.
