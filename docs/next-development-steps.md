**Implementation Tasks**:
```bash
# Backend Models & Routes
├── Post model with media support
├── Reaction model for positive interactions
├── Comment model for discussions
├── POST /api/posts - Create new post
├── GET /api/posts - Fetch feed posts
├── POST /api/posts/:id/react - Toggle reactions
└── POST /api/posts/:id/comments - Add comments

# Frontend Integration
├── Real API calls in feed
├── File upload for media posts
├── Real-time reaction updates
└── Comment threads
```

### **3. Looproom Foundation** (Week 3-4)
**Goal**: Implement basic Looproom creation and mood matching

**Implementation Tasks**:
```bash
# Database Schema
├── Looprooms table
├── Mood entries table
├── User-looproom relationships
└── Loopchain connections

# Core Features
├── Looproom creation interface
├── Basic mood matching algorithm
├── Room joining functionality
└── Creator room management
```

---

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation Guide**

### **Creator Verification Setup**

1. **File Upload Configuration**:
```javascript
// Add to backend
const multer = require('multer');
const storage = multer.diskStorage({
  destination: 'uploads/verification/',
  filename: (req, file, cb) => {
    cb(null, `${Date.now()}-${file.originalname}`);
  }
});
```

2. **Frontend File Upload Component**:
```typescript
// Document upload with preview
const DocumentUpload = () => {
  const [files, setFiles] = useState([]);
  // Drag & drop implementation
  // File validation
  // Preview functionality
};
```

### **Real Posts API Integration**

1. **Backend Post Routes**:
```javascript
// posts.js
router.post('/', authenticateUser, async (req, res) => {
  // Create post with media support
});

router.get('/', authenticateUser, async (req, res) => {
  // Fetch paginated posts with reactions
});
```

2. **Frontend API Integration**:
```typescript
// Replace mock data with real API calls
const fetchPosts = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/posts');
  const posts = await response.json();
  setPosts(posts);
};
```
